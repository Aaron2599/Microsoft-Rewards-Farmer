rough initial release. An undetected Microsoft Rewards Farmer that collects about 80% of the points you can earn on PC when you go idle for more than 5 minutes.

Everything is built with the average Windows user in mind, but you can still download and run it manually with Python. The MSI file installs it as a Windows application, binds it to startup, and automatically handles the installation of UV. Microsoft-Point-Farmer.vbs is the entry point that runs installer.bat in a hidden window. The installer ensures UV is installed, then calls start.bat to run main.py with UV using updated environment variables.
